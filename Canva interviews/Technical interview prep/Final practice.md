Formula
1. Simplify problem
	- Repeat the problem
		- The inputs are ___
		- We do ___ to the inputs
		- We get ___ as the output
		- Optional: Run though a test case
		- Ask questions: edges cases, clarifications
2. Brute force solution
	- Maybe show with example
	- Identify time and space complexity
	- Would you like me to implement this?
3. Optimise
	- What algo or data structure can we use here?
4. Debug/run through code with tests
